For now, this is my home on the internet.  All opinions expressed herein are my own.  Beware the dangers of extrapolation.

This page will be a bit bare for now.  I'll be adding stuff here as it pours from my head.  For now, just know that I like just about anything that makes my brain work a little bit, and I love anything that makes it work a lot.

I enjoy simplicity, both in life and in technology (is there a difference?).  Overcomplication is practiced by those who seek to appear more sophisticated than they really are.
